# Full Documentation Guide Reference

This skill is based on the comprehensive CS161 guide "How to Document an Existing System".

For detailed instructions and best practices, see: `/how_to_write_some_design_doc.md`

## Key Principles from the Guide

1. **"Understand before you document"** - Spend time exploring the codebase thoroughly
2. **Document the system as it exists**, not as you wish it to be
3. **Trace execution paths** to understand component interactions
4. **Include concrete examples** and code excerpts
5. **Explain the "why"**, not just the "what"

## Documentation Strategies

- **Top-down**: Start with entry points and trace down
- **Bottom-up**: Start with utilities and trace up
- **Follow-the-data**: Trace data structure lifecycle
- **Subsystem-focused**: Complete one subsystem before moving to next

## Quality Checklist

- Have you explained how every component works?
- Are vague descriptions replaced with concrete analysis?
- Do code examples illustrate key points?
- Have you identified edge cases and potential issues?
- Is the documentation useful for someone unfamiliar with the codebase?
