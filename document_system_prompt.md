# System Documentation Prompt

Given the following list of file paths, analyze and document this existing system following the structure outlined in "How to Document an Existing System" guide:

• **Read and analyze** all provided files plus any additional files they import/reference to understand the complete system architecture, tracing execution paths and identifying how components interact

• **Document the system** by creating sections for: Introduction (major subsystems overview), Architecture Overview (APIs, data structures, synchronization), and detailed Component Analysis (key functions, algorithms, edge cases) for each subsystem

• **Focus on clarity** by explaining not just what the code does but why it works that way, including concrete code examples, calling relationships, and any complex behaviors or potential issues you discover
