# Objective
Produce a comprehensive deep reading analysis of a research paper that enables a reader who has never seen the paper to fully understand its contributions, methods, results, and implications.

# Hard Requirements
- Assume zero prior knowledge: the reader has NOT read the paper and may not be familiar with domain-specific terminology.
- Define technical terms selectively: if a term or concept is uncommon, novel, or paper-specific, define it on first use. Skip definitions for standard field terminology (e.g., "neural network" in ML, "attention mechanism" in NLP, "runtime complexity" in algorithms).
- Explain mechanisms and approaches, not just what the paper claims—show HOW things work.
- Ground every claim in the paper's content: cite specific sections, figures, tables, or equations when discussing technical details or results.
- Do NOT use phrases like "the paper states" or "according to the authors" without explaining the underlying substance.
- Maintain logical flow: each section should build on previous context.

# Structure (Follow This Exact Order)

## 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
State the paper's core contribution and primary significance. Answer: What problem does this solve, and why does it matter?

## 2. Context and Motivation
- What specific problem or gap does this paper address?
- Why is this problem important (real-world impact, theoretical significance, or both)?
- What prior approaches existed, and where do they fall short?
- How does this paper position itself relative to existing work?

## 3. Technical Approach
- Break down the methodology, architecture, algorithm, or theoretical framework step-by-step.
- Explain the design choices: why this approach over alternatives?
- If mathematical: describe key equations, formulations, or proofs in plain language before showing notation.
- If empirical: describe the experimental design, data pipeline, model architecture, or system implementation.
- Use analogies or simplified examples when helpful for clarity.

## 4. Key Insights and Innovations
- Identify the 2-5 most novel contributions.
- For each: explain what makes it different from prior work and why it's significant (performance gain, theoretical advance, new capability, etc.).
- Distinguish between incremental improvements and fundamental innovations.

## 5. Experimental Analysis
- Describe evaluation methodology: datasets, metrics, baselines, experimental setup.
- Summarize main quantitative results with specific numbers and comparisons.
- Assess whether the experiments convincingly support the paper's claims.
- Note any ablation studies, failure cases, or robustness checks.
- If results are mixed or conditional, explain the conditions and trade-offs.

## 6. Limitations and Trade-offs
- What assumptions does the approach rely on?
- What scenarios, edge cases, or problem settings are NOT addressed?
- Are there computational, data, or scalability constraints?
- What weaknesses or open questions remain?

## 7. Implications and Future Directions
- How does this work change the landscape of the field?
- What follow-up research does it enable or suggest?
- What are the practical applications or downstream use cases?

# Output Format
- Use markdown headers (##) for each of the 7 sections above.
- Use bulleted lists for multi-point explanations.
- Use inline code formatting (`term`) for technical terms, variable names, or model names.
- Use block quotes or indentation when citing specific claims or results from the paper.
- Include specific figures, tables, or section references when discussing results (e.g., "Table 3 shows...").

# Tone and Style
- Write like a relatively modern person (gen z). Use conversational, accessible language—not stiff academic prose.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon, but when technical terms are needed, explain them naturally in context.
- Prioritize comprehension over brevity: explain complex ideas fully rather than tersely.
- Be critical but fair: highlight both strengths and weaknesses without being overly formal or detached.
- Use present tense for describing the paper's content (e.g., "The authors propose..." not "proposed").
- It's fine to be direct and opinionated when discussing limitations or impact—just back it up with reasoning.
